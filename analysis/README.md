# Analysis scripts template
This folder contains two template scripts implemented in Python and R that follow a recommended structure. Please mind to keep their structure.

# Structure of the template scripts:

## analysis.R
- **R version**: R version 4.0.3 (2020-10-10)
- **input**: This file reads inputs from the '/input' folder of your main remote repository. The input directory is specified in line 16 inside the script.
- **output**: This file places outputs in the '/output' folder of your main remote repository. The outpuut directory is specified in line 17 inside the script.
- **Libraries**: Please feel free to add your own libraries in line 12. **Delete lines 12-13, they are useless libraries, they are just examples**.
- **EXAMPLE**: In line 23 begins the example session of the analysis file. The input is specified in line 31, which is an 'example.txt' file inside the '/input' directory of your main remote repository. The output is file is specified in line 39, which is an 'output.txt' file inside the '/output' directory of your main remote repository. **Please execute the example once to test that everything works in the proper way**. 

## analysis.py
- **Python version**: Python 3.8.5 (default, Sep  4 2020, 07:30:14) 
- **input**: This file reads inputs from the '/input' folder of your main remote repository. The input directory is specified in line 17 inside the script.
- **output**: This file places outputs in the '/output' folder of your main remote repository. The outpuut directory is specified in line 18 inside the script.
- **Libraries**: Please feel free to add your own libraries in line 5.
- **EXAMPLE**: In line 28 begins the example session of the analysis file. The input is specified in line 32, which is an 'example.txt' file inside the '/input' directory of your main remote repository. The output is file is specified in line 39, which is an 'output.txt' file inside the '/output' directory of your main remote repository. **Please execute the example once to test that everything works in the proper way**.

## Important note!
**The results of your project should be regenerated by just executing either analysis.py or analysis.R script. Apparently, you can add more scripts if it is needed, however keep in mind to maintain the analysis scripts as your main scripts**.
