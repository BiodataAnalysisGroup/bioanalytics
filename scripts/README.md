# Already implemented scripts
In this folder are placed already implemented scripts that perfrom specific jobs.

## arc_diagram.R
- **input**: Inputs are placed inside the folder /input. Inputs should be of similar format as Clonotypes_X.txt files, where X = {14, 19, 20}. Inside the R script, inputs are specified in lines 28-30.
- **output**: Output is placed in the folder /output.
- **execute**: Just run the script, but first remember to specify the inputs in the script, as descibed above.
- **Installing required packages**: Uncomment and run lines 7-11 of the script. Hopefully, everything will be installed in the proper way, however it obviously depends on the R version.


## Important note
** If you add any script in this folder, please don't skip to add details in this README file**
