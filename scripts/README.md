# Already implemented scripts
In this folder are placed already implemented scripts that perfrom specific jobs.

## arc_diagram.R
- **input**: Inputs are placed inside the '/input/arc_diagram' folder of the remote project directory. Inputs should be of similar format as Clonotypes_X.txt files, where X = {14, 19, 20}. Inside the R script, inputs are specified in lines 30-32.
- **output**: Output is placed in the folder '/output/arc_diagram' folder of the remote project directory.
- **execute**: Just run the script, but first remember to specify the inputs in the script, as descibed above.
- **Installing required packages**: Uncomment and run lines 7-11 of the script. Hopefully, everything will be installed in the proper way, however it obviously depends on the R version.
