# Bioanalytics
A summary template repository, which contains all nessecary scripts that perform various processes, like constructing diagrams, statistically analyzing data and so on.

# Scripts

## arc_diagram.R
- **Short description**: Creating arc diagrams (?)
- **input**: Inputs are placed inside the folder arc_diagram/input. Inputs should be of the same structure as Clonotypes_X.txt files, where X = {14, 19, 20}. Inside      the R script, inputs are specified in lines 28-30.   
- **output**: Output is placed in the folder arc_diagram/output.
- **execute**: Just run the script, but first remember to specify the inputs in the script.
- **Installing required packages**: Uncomment and run lines 7-11 of the script. Hopefully, everything will be installed in the proper way, however it obviously depends on the R version.
