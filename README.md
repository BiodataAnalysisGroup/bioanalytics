# Bioanalytics - Research Project Template
This repository contains a template for a reproducible research project. The idea of reproducible research is that all the components of your work, such as the directory of input and output files, and evidently the structure and directory of analysis scripts, are prespecified. In this way, your work can be easily checked by adviser, mentors, collaborators, others working in your area, and the results can be easily regenerated by a click of a button.
This project also contains some already implemented scripts that that perform specific processes, like constructing diagrams, statistically analyzing data and so on.

# Folders
Brief description of the contents of each folder. 

## analysis
- This is the folder in which the analysis script(s) should be placed. Inside this folder there are **two template scripts in Python and R** with the recommended structure. Please mind to keep the structure as it is. 
- Apparently, you can add more scripts in this folder, but please mind to keep analyis.py and/or analysis.R as the **main scripts**. This means that the results should be regenerated by just running one of those scripts.
- There is also a README.md file inside this folder for more information.

## input
- **Short description**: Creating arc diagrams (?)
- **Contents**: An /input and /output subfolder, an arc_diagram.R script and a README.md file, including basic information on how to run the mini project.

## output
- **Short description**: Cloning comparison (?).
- **Contents**: An /input and /output subfolder, a cloning_comparison.R script and a README.md file, including basic information on how to run the mini project.

## scripts
- **Short description**: Gene repertoire comparison (?)
- **Contents**: An /input and /output subfolder, a gene_repertoire_comparison.R script and a README.md file, including basic information on how to run the mini project.
