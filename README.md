# Bioanalytics - Research Project Template
This repository contains a template for a reproducible research project. The idea of reproducible research is that all the components of your work, such as the directory of input and output files, and evidently the structure and directory of analysis scripts, are prespecified. In this way, your work can be easily checked by adviser, mentors, collaborators, others working in your area, and the results can be easily regenerated by a click of a button.
This project also contains some already implemented scripts that that perform specific processes, like constructing diagrams, statistically analyzing data and so on.

# Folders
Brief description of the contents of each folder. 

## analysis
- This is the folder in which the analysis script(s) should be placed. Inside this folder there are **two template scripts in Python and R** with the recommended structure. Please mind to keep the structure as it is. 
- Apparently, you can add more scripts in this folder, but please mind to keep analyis.py and/or analysis.R as the **main scripts**. This means that the results should be regenerated by just executing one of those scripts.
- There is also a README.md file inside this folder for more information.

## input
- This folder should contatin all the necessary inputs of your project.
- **Your inputs should be placed inside the '/input/analysis' directory**.
- Inside the '/input' directory, except from the '/analysis' folder, there are some extra folders that contain the inputs of the already implemented scripts. The names of these folders are the names of the corresponding scripts. For example, the '/arc_diagram' folder correspond to the arc_diagram.R script inside the scripts directory.

## output
- **Short description**: Cloning comparison (?).
- **Contents**: An /input and /output subfolder, a cloning_comparison.R script and a README.md file, including basic information on how to run the mini project.

## scripts
This folder contains **already implemented scripts that perform specific jobs**, as descibed below. Inside the folder, there is a README.md file for more information. **If you don't need them, please skip this folder completely**.
- **arc_diagram.R**: creating arc diagrams (?).
- **cloning_comparison.R**: Cloning comparison (?).
- **gene_repertoire_comparison.R**: Gene repertoire comparison (?).


**If you wish to add extra implemented scripts in this Research project, please mind to keep the recommended structure. This means that you should add script inside the '/scripts' directory and the inputs-outputs should be placed in the corresponding directories. Moreover, please don't skip to add instructions in the README.md files**
